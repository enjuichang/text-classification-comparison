# CS156 Final Project: Mandarin Chinese Text Classification

This was my final project for Machine Learning class (CS156). My topic was on the text classification of Mandarin Chinese. I wanted to evalulate the accuracies for various NLP deep learning techniques, namely Convolutional Neural Network (CNN),  Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory Network (BiLSTM), Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers model (BERT).

The dataset I tested on was `SMP2018ECDT` Corpus, a Simplified Chinese dataset on the Evaluation of Chinese Human-Computer Dialogue Technology (中文人机对话技术评测) that includes utterance and its associated tag. The main package I used was `kashgari`, which is a NLP package that simplified many processes during the construction of a NLP model.

## Content
- **Python Notebook**: Includes all the running code and discussion for the project.
- **PDF**: PDF version of the Notebook, which could be easier for reading.
